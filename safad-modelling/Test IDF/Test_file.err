   ** Warning ** CheckEnvironmentSpecifications: SimulationControl specified doing design day simulations, but no design environments specified.
   **   ~~~   ** ...No design environment results produced. For these results, add appropriate SizingPeriod:* objects for your simulation.
   ** Warning ** Weather file location will be used rather than entered (IDF) Location object.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Location object=CEBU CITY
   **   ~~~   ** ..Weather File Location=MACTAN - PHL IWEC2 WMO#=986460
   **   ~~~   ** ..due to location differences, Latitude difference=[5.00E-002] degrees, Longitude difference=[6.00E-002] degrees.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Time Zone difference=[0.0] hour(s), Elevation difference=[68.00] percent, [51.00] meters.
   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Compact="AF211_OCCUPANCY SCHEDULE" has missing day types in Through=12/31
   **   ~~~   ** Last "For" field=FOR: HOLIDAY
   **   ~~~   ** Missing day types="SummerDesignDay","WinterDesignDay","CustomDay1","CustomDay2"
   **   ~~~   ** Missing day types will have 0.0 as Schedule Values
   ** Warning ** CalcSurfaceCentroid: 5 Surfaces have the Z coordinate < 0.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Wind Speed will be 0.0 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Outside temperatures will be the outside temperature + 9.750E-003 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...that is, these surfaces will have conditions as though at ground level.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 4 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** GetShadowingInput: DetailedSkyDiffuseModeling is chosen but not needed as either the shading transmittance for shading devices does not change throughout the year
   **   ~~~   **  or MinimalShadowing has been chosen.
   **   ~~~   ** Simulation should be set to use SimpleSkyDiffuseModeling, but is left at Detailed for simulation.
   **   ~~~   ** Choose SimpleSkyDiffuseModeling in the ShadowCalculation object to reduce computation time.
   ** Warning ** Calculation of reflected solar onto surface=AF211_PLYBOARD_1 may be inaccurate
   **   ~~~   ** because it has one or more vertices below ground level.
   ** Warning ** Calculation of reflected solar onto surface=BAC353 may be inaccurate
   **   ~~~   ** because it has one or more vertices below ground level.
   ** Warning ** Calculation of reflected solar onto surface=6F287D may be inaccurate
   **   ~~~   ** because it has one or more vertices below ground level.
   ** Warning ** Calculation of reflected solar onto surface=A26EDF may be inaccurate
   **   ~~~   ** because it has one or more vertices below ground level.
   ** Warning ** Calculation of reflected solar onto surface=DE63C5 may be inaccurate
   **   ~~~   ** because it has one or more vertices below ground level.
   ** Warning ** No Glare Calculation Daylighting Reference Point Name provided for object named: DAYLIGHTING
   **   ~~~   ** No glare calculation performed, and the simulation continues.
   ** Warning ** CheckLightsReplaceable: Zone "ZONE 1_TEST" has Daylighting:Controls.
   **   ~~~   ** but all of the LIGHTS object in that zone have zero Fraction Replaceable.
   **   ~~~   ** The daylighting controls will have no effect.
